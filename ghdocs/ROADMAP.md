# Fabric Roadmap

## Planned Work
- **Create TypeScript implementations of each component.** This will remove our dependency on jQuery, which most teams are not in favor of, and standardize our code samples. Of course you are always free to write your own JavaScript or use whatever framework you prefer to interact with Fabric styles and components.

## Possible Future Improvements
- **Provide standard layouts for building full-page apps.** We've received a [request for this feature](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric/issues/284) and it's something we'd like to add once we have a more clearly-defined set of UI patterns. For now, please send us screenshots of your full-page apps so that we can understand what common layouts we could provide.
- **TreeView component.** See the [original request](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric/issues/238) for details.
- **Code snippets for Visual Studio.** This would be nice to have but is not a priority for us at this time. See the [original request](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric/issues/233) for details.
- **Custom HTML elements for components,** using something like [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/). See the [original request](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric/issues/223).
