# Fabric Roadmap

## Planned Work

## Future Improvements
- **Provide standard layouts for building full-page apps.** We've received a [request for this feature](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric/issues/284) and it's something we'd like to add once we have a more clearly-defined set of UI patterns. For now, please send us screenshots of your full-page apps so that we can understand what common layouts we could provide.
